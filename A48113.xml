            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LETTER, Of a JESUIT OF LIEGE, Concerning the Method of Eſtablishing the CATHOLIK RELIGION, In the Kingdom of ENGLAND.</head>
            <p>IT is to be admired with what affection the King proſecutes the affair of our Society; greeting the whole College by the Reverend Father Provincial and earneſtly recommending himſelf to our prayers, moſt gratiouſly admitted to him Provincial Father Jo: Regnes returned again into England (the Dukes and Earles being commanded to wait ſom hours for acceſſion) whom he asked in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Queen in a familiar manner, how many novices and how many ſcholars he had, the Provincial anſwered of the later about 20 of the former above 50 he repled that he ſhould have need of double or treble the number to performe that whith he deſigned for the Society
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:110099:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 65 -->and commanded that they ſhould be wel exerciſed in preaching for he ſaid that England did at this time want ſuch. I doubt not but you have heard of the Kings <hi>ſending</hi> letters to Father de la Chaiſe Confeſſor to the French King concerning the affair of the houſe of wattenens in whith he affirmed that whatſoever was don by the Engliſh Fathers of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety might be imputed to him, Father Clare Rector of the ſame houſe, acting in the ſame buſineſs at London found eaſy acceſs to the King, and in like manner eaſily obteyned his deſire; The King for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bade him to kneell and kiſs his hand as the manner is, ſaying indeed your Reverence once kiſſed my hand, but if I had then known as now I do that you were a Prieſt I would have rather kneelled and kiſſ'd your Reverence. After the buſnieſs was over, the King in a familiar diſcourſe told this Father he would either Convert England or dye a Martyr and had rather dye to morrow with the converſion of it than Reigne happily and piouſly 50 years with out it; Then he calls himſelf a ſon of the Society, in whoſe progreſs he ſaid he rejoyced in as his own, and tis hard to expreſs how thankfull he ſhew'd himſelf when he was told by the moſt Reverend. N. that he was made a partaker of all the merits of the Society, out of whith he declared his Confeſſor ſhould be (who it is as yet is not known) ſom report it to be the Reverend Father Provincial, whereof as yet there is no certainty. Many think that an Archbiſhopprick, moſt a Cardinals Cap will be given Father Edmond Petere who ſtands faireſt in the Kings favor, to whome for a month or two ſince, that part of the Royall Pallace is given, together with the Royall Chappell lately built, in whith the King whileſt he was Duke of York did uſually reſide; where you may every day ſee I know not how many Courtiers waiting to ſpeak with his Eminence, for tis ſaid ſo they call him. The King doth very much make uſe of this mans Councel and many of the Catholik Nobility, who poſſeſs the Chief Offices in the Kingdom, to find out a way of promoting the Faith without violence. Not long ſince certain of the Catholick No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility objected to the King that they thought he made too much haſt to eſtabliſh the Faith, to which he anſwered, I growing old muſt go forward ſpeedily, otherwiſe if I ſhould fortune to dye perhaps I ſhould leave you in a worſe condition than I found you, they replyed why then was he ſo unconcern'd in the Converſion of the daughters and heirs of the Kingdom he anſwered God will provide an heir, leave my daughters tome to be converted, you bring your owne ſlaves and others to the faith by your exemple. In many Countys he hath made the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:110099:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 65 -->chief and in a ſhort time we ſhall have Juſtices of the peace as they call them in almoſt all places we hope the affair at Oxford will ſucceed well, one of our Divines alwaye remains therein a publik Catholik Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of the Vice chancellor, who hath converted ſom ſtudents. The Biſhop of Oxford himſelf ſeems to favor the Catholik cauſe very much, he propoſed in Councell whether it was not expedient, that one College in Oxford at the leaſt ſhould be granted to the Catholiks, that they may not be compell'd to ſtudy beyond the ſeas at ſuch vaſt expences, but what anſwere was given is yet unknowne. Two of our party together with other nobles being invited to a Feaſt the ſame Biſhop drank the Kings health to a certain hereticall Baron there preſent, wiſhing him a happy ſucceſſe in all his affairs, and added that the proteſtant Religion in England ſeem'd to him to be in little better condition than Buda was before was attack'd, and thoſe who defended it were in a manner meer Atheiſts. Many do embrace the faith, and lately five of the chief Earles have publikly profeſſ'd it. The Reverend Father Alex. Regnes or Provincial, to whome is committed the care of the Chappel of the moſt ſerene Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor Palatines Embaſſador, employs his whole time in reſolving and ſatisfying the queſtions of hereticks doubting in their Religion, who you may ſee walking before the door of the Chappel, by two's and threes, controverting amongſt themſelves ſome thing concerning the Faith. We are uncertain that Prince George, profeſſeth the Faith, our aboad in England having been ſo ſhort. We teach the beſt ſort of morallity at Lincolne, Norwich and York; at Warwick we have a publick Chappel defended from all Injury by the Kings Souldiers. We have alſo bought a houſe in the City of Worcheſter. In the Country of Lancaſter the Catholick cauſe flouriſheth much, in ſome of the new Catholick Churches on Sundays above 1500 are numbered to be preſent at Sermon; at London the cauſe doth not go forward worſe, many Chappels are ſo frequented by the people on Sundays, for Divine Worſhip, that many of them are not big enough two of ours <hi>Darmes</hi> and <hi>Berfal</hi> conſtantly ſay Maſs in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the King and Queen, Father Edmond Newil before the Queen Dowager, Father Alex. Regnes in the Embaſſadors Chappel above mentioned others in other places; for the Chieff London Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge there are ſeveral Houſes bought in the Savoy, as they call it, near Somerſet-houſe the Queen Dowagers Palace for about eighteen thouſand livers; in reducing of which into the forme of a Colledge

               <!-- PDF PAGE 66 -->théy labour very hard, that the Schooles may be opened before Eaſter. In a ſhort time a Catholick Viceroy is to go into Ireland, no other will ſatisfy the Kings will, to eſtablish the Catholick cauſe there; for certain the Parliament will meet at London in the Month of February, from whom the King is reſolved to require three things,
<list>
                  <item>1. that by a general vote the Catholick Lords ſhall be admitted into the Upper-houſe.</item>
                  <item>2. That the Oath or Teſt be annull'd.</item>
                  <item>3. Which is the chief, that all penal Laws, madé againſt the Catholicks be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>péaled, which, that he might the more ſecurely obtain', he deſires it to be ſignifyed to all, that he is certainly reſolved to put all thoſe out of their employments, who will not act ſtrenuouſely for thoſe things, beſides a diſſolution of the Parliament.</item>
               </list> At which reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution ſome Heretiks being affrighted, came to a certain Earle to be adviſed what to do, to whom, ſaid he, the Kings will is ſufficiently known to us, what he once ſays, he will certainly do, if you love your ſelves, you ought to ſubmit to his will. There are great prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for a War at London, and a great Navy is to be ready againſt whom is uncertain. The Dutch are jealous, wherefore they begin to arme. Time will ſhew more.</p>
